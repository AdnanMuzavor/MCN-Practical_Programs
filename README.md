### MCN : Modern Computer Network

- You will find this repository filled with programs that portray various concepts in the above mentioned subject.

### Language : C++, JAVA

## Exp 01: Devices used in netorking

- Study of various netwroking devices and their significance.

## Exp 02: IP commands

- Study of various netwroking IP Commands and their significance.

## Error Detection Codes

## Exp 3:  Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

- It deals with **_CodeWord_** formation from sender side which is then sent to receiver.
- Receiver on receiving the data [ which is ***CodeWord*** ] validates it.
- If **_invalid_** sender shall **_resend_** the data otherwise sender can proceed with next set of data.

## Exp 4: Checksum

- First data to be sent is divided into blocks of equal size
- This blocks are added and the sum formed is complemented forming checksum
- This checksum is appended to the data to be sent and sent receiver
- Receiver on receiving the data [ which has ***checksum*** ] validates it.
- It adds up all the blocks and complements the sum
- If result of complemented sum is 0 then **No Error** Otherwise **Error**.

## Exp 5: Socket Programming
- To create a SOCKET for two way and one way communication between **server and client**.

## Exp 6: Knowing IP addresses
- Includes IP addressing fundamentals, classful IP addressing, CIDR and subnetting.

## Exp 7: Using The Cisco Packet Tracer
- In this experment we use Cisco packet tracer to form network topologies using switch and then router.
- Packet tracer was used effectively to send packet from one network to other using the router.
